    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962,with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comic editor and 
        head writer Stan lee was casting for a new superherp idea. He said the
        idea for Spide-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
        and the desir to create a charactor with whom teens could identify. As 
        with Fantastic Four,Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of 
        his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his Lorem ipsum
